*WIP*
Click game pieces to show their hidden icon. Find two matching icons to get a point. 
Everytime a match is found the player retains their turn and the matched pieces gets removed from the game.
Once a turn results in a no match, the turn passes to the next player.
Game ends once all pieces have been matched (removed) from the gameboard.
The winner is the one with the most points.
